# TOKI-Accommodation-Performance-Analysis-2024-2025
Data-driven analysis of TOKI Van Long’s hospitality performance (2024–Sept 2025), uncovering trends in sales, bookings, and stay duration.

# Project Background
TOKI is a Vietnamese hospitality brand with 4 operating branches in 3 provinces: Ninh Binh, Hoa Binh, and Vinh Phuc (specifically, Tam Dao). From the end of 2023, the company partnered with a new booking platform called EZCloud to create an All-in-one booking channel, integrating records from all sources, such as fan pages, website, and OTAs. The dataset in this project belongs to a retreat in Van Long, Ninh Binh, extracted directly from the EZCloud system with a timespan from 2024 to the end of September 2025.

As a Data Analyst, I was asked to "analyze sales, customers, and any valuable things" I might find (which I perceived as an EDA). In this project, I performed sales performance, booking performance, and stay duration analysis. 

The Spreadsheet files I used for data cleaning are in the repository or can be found here.

The report slides for presentation can be found here.
